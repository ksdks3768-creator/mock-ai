2.  "weaknesses": An array of strings suggesting areas for improvement. Frame these as actionable tips, not just criticisms.
3.  "idealAnswer": A concise, well-structured example of an ideal answer. It should sound natural, like how a top candidate would actually speak. Avoid jargon where possible.
4.  "spokenFeedback": A comprehensive, conversational, and encouraging summary to be spoken aloud. Start by addressing the candidate warmly. Briefly cover the strengths and areas for improvement in a friendly tone, and then smoothly transition into suggesting the ideal answer as a helpful example. Keep it sounding like genuine, spoken advice from a coach.
5.  "matchedKeywords": An array of strings from the "Essential Keywords" list that were present or clearly alluded to in the candidate's answer.
6.  "missedKeywords": An array of strings from the "Essential Keywords" list that were NOT mentioned in the answer.
7.  "score": A numerical score from 0 to 10 evaluating the answer's quality, with 10 being a perfect answer.
8.  "rating": A rating of "Beginner", "Intermediate", or "Advanced" based on the score and overall quality. A score < 4 is Beginner, 4-7 is Intermediate, and > 7 is Advanced.
